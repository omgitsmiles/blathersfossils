# Blathers Directory

The following project dives into the world of animal crossing and gives the user a pared down experience of Blathers encyclopedic knowledge of:  
   - Fossils
   - Bugs

Using the [Animal Crossing New Horizon API](https://acnhapi.com/v1/bugs), I have created a single page application with three unique features.

### Dig
In spirit of the game, the villager sprite in the right takes their shovel and digs around the island for a fossil. 
With the click of the dig button, the villager digs up a randomly generated fossil!

Blathers, a local island scholar, identifies the the fossil that was found and appends an image and a description of the fossil.
