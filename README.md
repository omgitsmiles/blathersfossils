# Blathers Directory

The following project dives into the world of animal crossing and gives the user a pared down experience of Blathers encyclopedic knowledge of:  
   - Fossils
   - Bugs

Using the [Animal Crossing New Horizon API](https://acnhapi.com/v1/bugs), I have created a single page application with three unique features.

### Dig
In spirit of the game, the villager sprite in the right takes their shovel and digs around the island for a fossil. 
With the click of the dig button, the villager digs up a randomly generated fossil!

Blathers, a local island scholar, identifies the the fossil that was found and appends an image and a description of the fossil.

### Search
Even though Blathers wasn't a fan of bugs, begrudgingly he has added a search feature to give the same information of the bugs in the island.
With a simple search query, you can have access to the bugs and a brief description, along with blathers personal disdain for each one.

### Donate
In the game, Blathers upkeeps a museum of the villagers findings that are taken to him. So it wouldn't a full Blathers experience without the ability to donate to his museum! functionality is done after you fetch a fossil. After he identifies, the user has the ability to donate his finding to Blathers. The image of the fossil should render right below Blathers.
